<h3>REMARKS.</h3>

<p>This comedy, by a favourite writer, had a reception,
on the first night of its appearance, far inferior to
that of his other productions. It was, with difficulty,
saved from condemnation; and the author, in his preface,
has boldly charged some secret enemies with
having attempted its destruction.</p>

<p>Dramatic authors have fewer enemies at the present
period, or they have more humility, than formerly.
For now, when their works are hissed from
the stage, they acknowledge they have had a fair trial,
and deserve their fate. Wherefore should an author
seek for remote causes, to account for his failures,
when to himself alone, he is certain ever to impute all
his success?</p>

<p>Neither the wit, humour, nor the imitation of nature,
in this play, are of that forcible kind, with which
the audience had been usually delighted by Farquhar;
and, that the moral gave a degree of superiority
to this drama, was, in those days, of little consequence:
the theatre was ordained, it was thought,
for mere pleasure, nor did any one wish it should
degenerate into instruction.</p>

<p>It may be consolatory to the disappointed authors
of the present day, to find, how the celebrated author
of this comedy was incommoded with theatrical
crosses. He was highly offended, that his play was
not admired; still more angry, that there was an
empty house, on his sixth night, and more angry
still, that the Opera House, for the benefit of a
French dancer, was, about this time, filled even to the
annoyance of the crowded company. The following
are his own words on the occasion:</p>

<p>"It is the prettiest way in the world of despising
the French king, to let him see that we can afford money
to bribe his dancers, when he, poor man, has exhausted
all his stock, in buying some pitiful towns
and principalities. What can be a greater compliment
to our generous nation, than to have the lady on
her re-tour to Paris, boast of her splendid entertainment
in England: of the complaisance, liberty, and
good nature of a people, who thronged her house so
full, that she had not room to stick a pin; and left a
poor fellow, who had the misfortune of being one
of themselves, without one farthing, for half a year's
pains he had taken for their entertainment."</p>

<p>This complaint is curious, on account of the talents
of the man who makes it; and, for the same cause,
highly reprehensible. If Farquhar, thought himself
superior to the French dancer, why did he honour
her by a comparison? and, if he wanted bread,
why did he not suffer in silence, rather than insinuate,
he should like to receive it, through the
medium of a benefit?</p>

<p>A hundred years of refinement (the exact time
since this author wrote) may have weakened the force
of the dramatic pen; but it has, happily, elevated
authors above the servile spirit of dedications, or the
meaner practice, of taking public benefits.</p>

<p>As the moral of this comedy has been mentioned
as one of its highest recommendations, it must be
added&mdash;that, herein, the author did not invent, but
merely adopt, as his own, an occurrence which
took place in Paris, about that period, just as he has
represented it in his last act. The Chevalier de
Chastillon was the man who is personated by young
Mirabel, in this extraordinary event; and the Chevalier's
friend, his betrothed wife, and his beautiful
courtesan, are all exactly described in the characters
of Duretete, Oriana, and Lamorce.</p>

<p>Having justly abridged Farquhar of the honour
of inventing a moral, it may be equally just, to
make a slight apology for his chagrin at the slender
receipts of his sixth night.&mdash;He once possessed the
income, which arose from a captain's commission in the
army; and having prudently conceived that this little
revenue would not maintain a wife, he had resolved to
live single, unless chance should bestow on him a woman
of fortune. His person and address were so
extremely alluring, that a woman of family, but of
no fortune, conceiving the passion she felt for him to
be love, pretended she possessed wealth, and deceived
him into a marriage, which plunged them both
into the utmost poverty.</p>

<p>This admirable dramatist seems to have been born
for a dupe. In his matrimonial distress, he applied
to a nobleman, who had professed a friendship for
him, and besought his advice how to surmount his
difficulties: The counsel given, was&mdash;"Sell your
commission, for present support, and, before the money
for its sale is expended, I will procure you another."
Farquhar complied&mdash;and his patron broke
his word.</p>

<h4>SCENE I.</h4>

<br />
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dugard</span>, <i>and his Man</i>, <span class="smallcaps">Petit</span>, <i>in Riding<br />
Habits</i>.<br />
</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Dug.</i> Sirrah, what's o'clock?</p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> Turned of eleven, sir.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> No more! We have rid a swinging pace from
Nemours, since two this morning! Petit, run to Rousseau's,
and bespeak a dinner, at a Lewis d'or a head,
to be ready by one.</p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> How many will there be of you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Let me see&mdash;Mirabel one, Duretete two, myself
three<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>
<i>Petit.</i> And I four.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> How now, sir? at your old travelling familiarity!
When abroad, you had some freedom, for want
of better company, but among my friends, at Paris,
pray remember your distance&mdash;Begone, sir! [<i>Exit</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Petit</span>.] This fellow's wit was necessary abroad, but
he's too cunning for a domestic; I must dispose of
him some way else.&mdash;Who's here? Old Mirabel, and
my sister!&mdash;my dearest sister!</p>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Old Mirabel</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Oriana</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Oriana.</i> My Brother! Welcome!</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Monsieur Mirabel! I'm heartily glad to see
you.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Honest Mr. Dugard, by the blood of the
Mirabels, I'm your most humble servant!</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Why, sir, you've cast your skin, sure; you're
brisk and gay&mdash;lusty health about you&mdash;no sign of
age, but your silver hairs.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Silver hairs! Then they are quicksilver
hairs, sir. Whilst I have golden pockets, let my hairs
be silver, an' they will. Adsbud, sir, I can dance, and
sing, and drink, and&mdash;no, I can't wench. But Mr.
Dugard, no news of my son Bob in all your travels?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Your son's come home, sir.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Come home! Bob come home! By the
blood of the Mirabels, Mr. Dugard, what say you?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Mr. Mirabel returned, sir?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> He's certainly come, and you may see him
within this hour or two.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Swear it, Mr. Dugard, presently swear
it.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Sir, he came to town with me this morning;
I left him at the Banieurs, being a little disordered after
riding, and I shall see him again presently.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> What! and he was ashamed to ask a
blessing with his boots on! A nice dog! Well, and
how fares the young rogue, ha?</p>
<p>
<i>Dug.</i> A fine gentleman, sir; he'll be his own messenger.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> A fine gentleman! But is the rogue like
me still?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Why, yes, sir; he's very like his mother, and
as like you, as most modern sons are to their fathers.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Why, sir, don't you think that I begat
him?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Why, yes, sir; you married his mother, and
he inherits your estate. He's very like you, upon my
word.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> And pray, brother, what's become of his
honest companion, Duretete?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Who, the captain? The very same, he went
abroad; he's the only Frenchman I ever knew, that
could not change. Your son, Mr. Mirabel, is more
obliged to nature for that fellow's composition, than
for his own: for he's more happy in Duretete's folly
than his own wit. In short, they are as inseparable
as finger and thumb; but the first instance in the
world, I believe, of opposition in friendship.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Very well: will he be home, to dinner,
think ye?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Sir, he has ordered me to bespeak a dinner
for us at Rousseau's, at a Lewis d'or a head.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> A Lewis d'or a head! Well said, Bob; by
the blood of the Mirabels, Bob's improved! But, Mr.
Dugard, was it so civil of Bob, to visit Monsieur Rousseau,
before his own natural father, eh? Harkye,
Oriana, what think you now, of a fellow that can eat
and drink ye a whole Lewis d'or at a sitting? He must
be as strong as Hercules; life and spirit in abundance.
Before Gad, I don't wonder at these men of
quality, that their own wives can't serve them! A
Lewis d'or a head! 'tis enough to stock the whole nation
with bastards, 'tis, 'faith! Mr. Dugard, I leave
you with your sister.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Well, sister, I need not ask you how you do,
your looks resolve me; fair, tall, well-shaped; you're
almost grown out of my remembrance.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Why, truly, brother, I look pretty well,
thank nature, and my toilet; I eat three meals a day,
am very merry when up, and sleep soundly when I'm
down.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> But, sister, you remember that upon my going
abroad, you would chuse this old gentleman for your
guardian; he's no more related to our family, than
Prester John, and I have no reason to think you mistrusted
my management of your fortune. Therefore,
pray be so kind as to tell me, without reservation, the
true cause of making such a choice.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Lookye, brother, you were going a rambling,
and 'twas proper, lest I should go a rambling
too, that somebody should take care of me. Old
Monsieur Mirabel is an honest gentleman, was our father's
friend, and has a young lady in his house, whose
company I like, and who has chosen him for her guardian
as well as I.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Who, Mademoiselle Bisarre?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> The same; we live merrily together, without
scandal or reproach; we make much of the old
gentleman between us, and he takes care of us; all
the week we dance and sing, and upon Sundays, go
first to church, and then to the play.&mdash;Now, brother,
besides these motives for chusing this gentleman for
my guardian, perhaps I had some private reasons.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Not so private as you imagine, sister; your
love to young Mirabel's no secret, I can assure you,
but so public, that all your friends are ashamed
on't.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> O' my word, then, my friends are very bashful;
though I'm afraid, sir, that those people are not
ashamed enough at their own crimes, who have so
many blushes to spare for the faults of their neighbours.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Ay, but, sister, the people say<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Pshaw! hang the people! they'll talk
treason, and profane their Maker; must we, therefore
infer, that our king is a tyrant, and religion a cheat?
Lookye, brother, their court of inquiry is a tavern,
and their informer, claret: They think as they drink,
and swallow reputations like loches; a lady's health
goes briskly round with the glass, but her honour is
lost in the toast.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Ay, but sister, there is still something<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> If there be something, brother, 'tis none of
the people's something: Marriage is my thing, and
I'll stick to't.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Marriage! young Mirabel marry! he'll
build churches sooner. Take heed, sister, though
your honour stood proof to his home-bred assaults,
you must keep a stricter guard for the future: He
has now got the foreign air, and the Italian softness;
his wit's improved by converse, his behaviour finished
by observation, and his assurances confirmed by success.
Sister, I can assure you, he has made his conquests;
and 'tis a plague upon your sex, to be the
soonest deceived, by those very men that you know
have been false to others.&mdash;But then, sister, he's as
fickle&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> For God's sake, brother, tell me no more
of his faults, for, if you do, I shall run mad for him:
Say no more, sir; let me but get him into the bands
of matrimony, I'll spoil his wandering, I warrant
him; I'll do his business that way, never fear.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Well, sister, I won't pretend to understand
the engagements between you and your lover; I expect
when you have need of my counsel or assistance,
you will let me know more of your affairs. Mirabel
is a gentleman, and as far as my honour and interest
can reach, you may command me, to the furtherance
of your happiness: In the mean time, sister, I have a
great mind to make you a present of another humble
servant; a fellow that I took up at Lyons, who has
served me honestly ever since.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Then why will you part with him?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> He has gained so insufferably on my good-humour,
that he's grown too familiar; but the fellow's
cunning, and may be serviceable to you in your
affair with Mirabel. Here he comes.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Petit</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Well, sir, have you been at Rousseau's?</p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> Yes, sir, and who should I find there but
Mr. Mirabel and the captain, hatching as warmly
over a tub of ice, as two hen pheasants over a brood&mdash;They
would not let me bespeak any thing, for they
had dined before I came.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Come, sir, you shall serve my sister, I shall
still continue kind to you; and if your lady recommends
your diligence, upon trial, I'll use my interest
to advance you.&mdash;Wait on your lady home, Petit.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> A chair! a chair! a chair!</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> No, no, I'll walk home, 'tis but next door.<span class="ex">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Welcome to Paris once more, my dear
Captain; we have eat heartily, drank roundly, paid
plentifully, and let it go for once. I liked every thing
but our women; they looked so lean and tawdry,
poor creatures! 'Tis a sure sign the army is not paid.
Give me the plump Venetian, brisk, and sanguine,
that smiles upon me like the glowing sun, and meets
my lips like sparkling wine, her person, shining as
the glass, and spirit, like the foaming liquor.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Ah, Mirabel, Italy I grant you; but for our
women here in France, they are such thin, brawn,
fallen jades, a man may as well make a bed-fellow of
a cane chair.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> France! A light, unseasoned country, nothing
but feathers, foppery, and fashions.&mdash;There's nothing
on this side the Alps worth my humble service
t'ye&mdash;Ha, Roma la Santa!&mdash;Italy for my money!&mdash;their
customs, gardens, buildings, paintings, music,
policies, wine, and women! the paradise of the
world!&mdash;not pestered with a parcel of precise, old,
gouty fellows, that would debar their children every
pleasure, that they themselves are past the sense of;&mdash;commend
me to the Italian familiarity&mdash;"Here, son,
there's fifty crowns, go, pay your girl her week's allowance."</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Ay, these are your fathers, for you, that understand
the necessities of young men! not like our
musty dads, who, because they cannot fish themselves,
would muddy the water, and spoil the sport of them
that can. But now you talk of the plump, what d'ye
think of a Dutch woman?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> A Dutch woman's too compact,&mdash;nay,
every thing among them is so; a Dutch man is thick,
a Dutch woman is squab, a Dutch horse is round, a
Dutch dog is short, a Dutch ship is broad bottomed;
and, in short, one would swear, that the whole product
of the country were cast in the same mould with
their cheeses.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Ay, but Mirabel, you have forgot the English
ladies.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> The women of England were excellent, did
they not take such unsufferable pains to ruin, what nature
has made so incomparably well; they would be
delicate creatures indeed, could they but thoroughly
arrive at the French mien, or entirely let it alone; for
they only spoil a very good air of their own, by an
awkward imitation of ours. But come, Duretete, let
us mind the business in hand; Mistresses we must
have, and must take up with the manufacture of the
place, and upon a competent diligence, we shall find
those in Paris shall match the Italians from top to
toe.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Ay, Mirabel, you will do well enough, but
what will become of your friend? you know, I am so
plaguy bashful! so naturally an ass upon these occasions,
that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Pshaw! you must be bolder, man! Travel
three years, and bring home such a baby as bashfulness!
A great lusty fellow, and a soldier; fie upon
it!</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Lookye, sir, I can visit, and I can ogle a little,&mdash;as
thus, or thus now. Then I can kiss abundantly&mdash;but
if they chance to give me a forbidding
look, as some women, you know, have a devilish cast
with their eyes&mdash;or if they cry, "What do you mean?
what d'ye take me for? Fie, sir, remember who I am,
sir&mdash;A person of quality to be used at this rate!"&mdash;'Egad,
I'm struck as flat as a fryingpan.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Words of course! never mind them: Turn
you about upon your heel, with a jant&eacute;e air; hum out
the end of an old song; cut a cross caper, and at her
again.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> [<i>Imitates him.</i>] No, hang it, 'twill never do!&mdash;Oons!
what did my father mean, by sticking me
up in an university, or to think that I should gain any
thing by my head, in a nation, whose genius lies all in
their heels!&mdash;Well, if ever I come to have children of
my own, they shall have the education of the country&mdash;they
shall learn to dance, before they can walk,
and be taught to sing, before they can speak.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Come, come, throw off that childish humour&mdash;put
on assurance, there's no avoiding it; stand
all hazards, thou'rt a stout, lusty fellow, and hast a
good estate;&mdash;look bluff, hector, you have a good side-box
face, a pretty impudent face; so, that's pretty well.&mdash;This
fellow went abroad like an ox, and is returned
like an ass.<span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Let me see now, how I look. [<i>Pulls out a
Pocket Glass, and looks on it.</i>] A side-box face, say
you!&mdash;'Egad, I don't like it, Mirabel! Fie, sir, don't
abuse your friends, I could not wear such a face for
the best countess in christendom.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Why can't you, blockhead, as well as I?</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Why, thou hast impudence to set a good face
upon any thing; I would change half my gold for
half thy brass, with all my heart. Who comes here?
Odso, Mirabel, your father!</p>

</div>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Where's Bob?&mdash;dear Bob?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Your blessing, sir?</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> My blessing! Damn ye, ye young rogue,
why did not you come to see your father first, sirrah?
My dear boy, I am heartily glad to see thee, my dear
child, 'faith!&mdash;Captain Duretete, by the blood of the
Mirabels, I'm yours! Well, my lads, ye look bravely,
'faith.&mdash;Bob, hast got any money left?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Not a farthing, sir.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Why, then, I won't gi' thee a souse.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> I did but jest, here's ten pistoles.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Why, then, here's ten more: I love to be
charitable to those that don't want it.&mdash;Well, and
how do you like Italy, my boys?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> O, the garden of the world, sir! Rome,
Naples, Venice, Milan, and a thousand others&mdash;all
fine.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Ay! say you so? And they say, that Chiari
is very fine too.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Indifferent, sir, very indifferent; a very scurvy
air, the most unwholesome to a French constitution
in the world.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Pshaw! nothing on't: these rascally gazetteers
have misinformed you.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Misinformed me! Oons, sir, were we not
beaten there?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Beaten, sir! we beaten!</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Why, how was it, pray, sweet sir?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Sir, the captain will tell you.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> No, sir, your son will tell you.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> The captain was in the action, sir.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Your son saw more than I, sir, for he was a
looker on.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Confound you both, for a brace of cowards!
here are no Germans to overhear you&mdash;why
don't ye tell me how it was?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Why, then, you must know, that we marched
up a body of the finest, bravest, well dressed fellows
in the universe; our commanders at the head of
us, all lace and feather, like so many beaux at a ball&mdash;I
don't believe there was a man of them but could
dance a charmer, Morbleau.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Dance! very well, pretty fellows, 'faith!</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> We capered up to their very trenches, and
there saw, peeping over, a parcel of scare-crow,
olive-coloured, gunpowder fellows, as ugly as the devil.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> E'gad, I shall never forget the looks of them,
while I have breath to fetch.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> They were so civil, indeed, as to welcome
us with their cannon! but for the rest, we found them
such unmannerly, rude, unsociable dogs, that we grew
tired of their company, and so we e'en danced back
again.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> And did ye all come back?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> No, two or three thousand of us staid behind.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Why, Bob, why?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Pshaw! because they could not come that
night.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> No, sir, because they could not come that
night.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> But, come, sir, we were talking of something
else; pray, how does your lovely charge, the fair
Oriana?</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Ripe, sir, just ripe; you'll find it better
engaging with her than with the Germans, let me tell
you. And what would you say, my young Mars, if
I had a Venus for thee too? Come, Bob, your apartment
is ready, and pray let your friend be my guest
too; you shall command the house between ye, and
I'll be as merry as the best of you.<span class="ex">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Bis.</i> And you love this young rake, d'ye?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> In spite of all his ill usage?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> I can't help it.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> What's the matter wi' ye?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Pshaw!</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> Um!&mdash;before that any young, lying, swearing,
flattering, rakehelly fellow, should play such tricks
with me&mdash;O, the devil take all your Cassandras and
Cleopatras for me.&mdash;I warrant now, you'll play the
fool when he comes, and say you love him! eh?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Most certainly; I can't dissemble, Bisarre;
besides, 'tis past that, we're contracted.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> Contracted! alack-a-day, poor thing!&mdash;What,
you have changed rings, or broken an old broadpiece
between you! I would make a fool of any fellow in
France. Well, I must confess, I do love a little coquetting,
with all my heart! my business should be
to break gold with my lover one hour, and crack my
promise the next; he should find me one day with a
prayer book in my hand, and with a play book another.&mdash;He
should have my consent to buy the
wedding ring, and the next moment would I ask him
his name.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> O, my dear! were there no greater tie upon
my heart, than there is upon my conscience, I
would soon throw the contract out of doors; but the
mischief on't is, I am so fond of being tied, that I'm
forced to be just, and the strength of my passion keeps
down the inclination of my sex.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> But here's the old gentleman!</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Old Mirabel</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Where's my wenches?&mdash;where's my two
little girls? Eh! Have a care,&mdash;look to yourselves,
'faith, they're a coming&mdash;the travellers are a coming!
Well! which of you two will be my daughter-in-law
now? Bisarre, Bisarre, what say you, madcap? Mirabel
is a pure, wild fellow.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> I like him the worse.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> You lie, hussy, you like him the better,
indeed you do! What say you, my t'other little filbert,
eh?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> I suppose the gentleman will chuse for himself,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Why, that's discreetly said, and so he
shall.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Bob, harkye, you shall marry one of these girls, sirrah!</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Sir, I'll marry them both, if you please.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] He'll find that one may serve his turn.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Both! why, you young dog, d'ye banter
me?&mdash;Come, sir, take your choice.&mdash;Duretete, you
shall have your choice too, but Robin shall chuse first.&mdash;Come,
sir, begin. Well! which d'ye like?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Both.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> But which will you marry?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Neither.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Neither! Don't make me angry now,
Bob&mdash;pray, don't <ins title="original lacks make">make</ins> me angry.&mdash;Lookye, sirrah, if I
don't dance at your wedding to-morrow, I shall be
very glad to cry at your grave.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> That's a bull, father.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> A bull! Why, how now, ungrateful sir,
did I make thee a man, that thou shouldst make me
a beast?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Your pardon, sir; I only meant your expression.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Harkye, Bob, learn better manners to
your father before strangers! I won't be angry this
time: But oons, if ever you do't again, you rascal!&mdash;remember
what I say.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Pshaw! what does the old fellow mean by
mewing me up here with a couple of green girls?&mdash;Come,
Duretete, will you go?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> I hope, Mr. Mirabel, you han't forgot&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> No, no, madam, I han't forgot, I have
brought you a thousand little Italian curiosities; I'll
assure you, madam, as far as a hundred pistoles would
reach, I han't forgot the least circumstance.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Sir, you misunderstand me.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Odso! the relics, madam, from Rome. I
do remember, now, you made a vow of chastity before
my departure; a vow of chastity, or something like
it&mdash;was it not, madam?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> O sir, I'm answered at present.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> She was coming full mouth upon me with
her contract&mdash;'Would I might despatch t'other!</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Mirabel, that lady there, observe her, she's
wondrous pretty, 'faith! and seems to have but few
words; I like her mainly&mdash;speak to her, man, pr'ythee
speak to her.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Madam, here's a gentleman, who declares<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Madam, don't believe him, I declare nothing&mdash;What,
the devil, do you mean, man?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> He says, madam, that you are as beautiful
as an angel.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> He tells a damned lie, madam! I say no such
thing&mdash;Are you mad, Mirabel? Why, I shall drop
down with shame.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> And so, madam, not doubting but your
ladyship may like him as well as he does you, I think
it proper to leave you together.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Going</i>, <span class="smallcaps">Duretete</span> <i>holds him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Hold, hold&mdash;Why, Mirabel, friend, sure you
won't be so barbarous as to leave me alone! Pr'ythee,
speak to her for yourself, as it were! Lord, Lord,
that a Frenchman should want impudence!</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> You look mighty demure, madam.&mdash;She's
deaf, Captain.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> I had much rather have her dumb.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> The gravity of your air, madam, promises
some extraordinary fruits from your study, which
moves us with curiosity to inquire the subject of your
ladyship's contemplation.&mdash;Not a word!</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> I hope in the Lord, she's speechless! if she
be, she's mine this moment. Mirabel, d'ye think a
woman's silence can be natural?</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> But the forms which logicians introduce, and
which proceed from simple enumeration, are dubitable,
and proceed only upon admittance&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Hoyty toyty! what a plague have we
here? Plato in petticoats!</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Ay, ay, let her go on, man; she talks in my
own mother tongue.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> 'Tis exposed to invalidity, from a contradictory
instance; looks only upon common operations, and is
infinite in its termination.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Rare pedantry!</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Axioms! axioms! self-evident principles!</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> Then the ideas wherewith the mind is pre-occupate.&mdash;O,
gentlemen, I hope you'll pardon my cogitation!
I was involved in a profound point of philosophy,
but I shall discuss it somewhere else, being
satisfied, that the subject is not agreeable to your
sparks, that profess the vanity of the times.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Go thy way, good wife Bias! Do you
hear, Duretete? Dost hear this starched piece of austerity?</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> She's mine, man, she's mine&mdash;My own talent
to a T.&mdash;I'll match her in dialectics, 'faith! I was seven
years at the university, man, nursed up with Barbaro,
Celarunt, Darii, Ferio, Baralipton. Did you ever
know, man, that 'twas metaphysics made me an ass? It
was, 'faith! Had she talked a word of singing, dancing,
plays, fashions, or the like, I had foundered at the
first step; but as she is&mdash;Mirabel, wish me joy!</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> You don't mean marriage, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> No, no, I am a man of more honour.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Bravely resolved, Captain! now for thy
credit&mdash;warm me this frozen snowball&mdash;'twill be a
conquest above the Alps!</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> But will you promise to be always near me?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Upon all occasions, never fear.</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> Why, then, you shall see me, in two moments,
make an induction from my love to her hand, from
her hand to her mouth, from her mouth to her heart,
and so conclude in her bed, categorematice.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Now the game begins, and my fool is entered.&mdash;But
here comes one to spoil my sport; now
shall I be teased to death, with this old-fashioned contract!
I should love her too, if I might do it my own
way, but she'll do nothing without witnesses, forsooth!
I wonder women can be so immodest!</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Oriana</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Well, madam, why d'ye follow me?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Well, sir, why do you shun me?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> 'Tis my humour, madam, and I'm naturally
swayed by inclination.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Have you forgot our contract, sir?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> All I remember of that contract is, that it
was made some three years ago, and that's enough, in
conscience, to forget the rest on't.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> 'Tis sufficient, sir, to recollect the passing
of it; for, in that circumstance, I presume, lies the
force of the obligation.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Obligations, madam, that are forced upon
the will, are no tie upon the conscience; I was a
slave to my passion, when I passed the instrument, but
the recovery of my freedom makes the contract void.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Come, Mr. Mirabel, these expressions I expected
from the raillery of your humour, but I hope
for very different sentiments from your honour and
generosity.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Lookye, madam, as for my generosity, 'tis
at your service, with all my heart: I'll keep you a
coach and six horses, if you please, only permit me to
keep my honour to myself. Consider, madam, you
have no such thing among ye, and 'tis a main point
of policy to keep no faith with reprobates&mdash;thou art
a pretty little reprobate, and so get thee about thy business!</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Well, sir, even all this I will allow to the
gaiety of your temper; your travels have improved
your talent of talking, but they are not of force, I
hope, to impair your morals.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Morals! why, there 'tis again now!&mdash;I tell
thee, child, there is not the least occasion for morals,
in any business between you and I. Don't you know
that, of all commerce in the world, there is no such
cozenage and deceit, as in the traffic between man and
woman? we study all our lives long, how to put
tricks upon one another.&mdash;No fowler lays abroad more
nets for his game, nor a hunter for his prey, than you
do, to catch poor innocent men.&mdash;Why do you sit
three or four hours at your toilet in a morning? only
with a villanous design to make some poor fellow a
fool before night. What d'ye sigh for?&mdash;What d'ye
weep for?&mdash;What d'ye pray for? Why, for a husband:
That is, you implore Providence to assist you, in the
just, and pious design, of making the wisest of his
creatures a fool, and the head of the creation, a slave.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Sir, I am proud of my power, and am resolved
to use it.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Hold, hold, madam, not so fast&mdash;As you
have variety of vanities to make coxcombs of us; so
we have vows, oaths, and protestations, of all sorts
and sizes, to make fools of you&mdash;And this, in short,
my dear creature, is our present condition. I have
sworn, and lied, briskly, to gain my ends of you;
your ladyship has patched and painted violently, to
gain your ends of me; but, since we are both disappointed,
let us make a drawn battle, and part clear on
both sides.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> With all my heart, sir! give me up my
contract, and I'll never see your face again.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Indeed, I won't, child!</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> What, sir! neither do one nor t'other?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> No, you shall die a maid, unless you please
to be otherwise, upon my terms.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> What do you intend by this, sir?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Why, to starve you into compliance;&mdash;lookye,
you shall never marry any man; and you had
as good let me do you a kindness as a stranger.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Sir, you're a<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> What am I, ma'am?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> A villain, sir.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> I'm glad on't&mdash;I never knew an honest
fellow in my life, but was a villain upon these occasions.
Han't you drawn yourself, now, into a very
pretty dilemma? ha! ha! ha! the poor lady has
made a vow of virginity, when she thought of making
a vow to the contrary. Was ever poor woman so
cheated into chastity?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Sir, my fortune is equal to yours, my
friends as powerful, and both shall be put to the test,
to do me justice.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> What! you'll force me to marry you, will
ye?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Sir, the law shall.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> But the law can't force me to do any thing
else, can it?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> Pshaw, I despise thee&mdash;Monster!</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Kiss and be friends, then&mdash;Don't cry, child,
and you shall have your sugar plumb&mdash;Come, madam,
d'ye think I could be so unreasonable as to
make you fast all your life long! No, I did but jest,
you shall have your liberty&mdash;here, take your contract,
and give me mine.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> No, I won't.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Eh! What, is the girl a fool?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> No, sir, you shall find me cunning enough
to do myself justice; and since I must not depend upon
your love, I'll be revenged, and force you to marry
me, out of spite.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Then I'll beat thee out of spite, and
make a most confounded husband!</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> O, sir, I shall match ye! A good husband
makes a good wife at any time.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> I'll rattle down your china about your ears.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> And I'll rattle about the city, to run you in
debt for more.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> I'll tear the furbelow off your clothes, and
when you swoon for vexation, you shan't have a penny,
to buy a bottle of hartshorn.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> And you, sir, shall have hartshorn in
abundance.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> I'll keep as many mistresses as I have
coach horses.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> And I'll keep as many gallants as you have
grooms.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> But, sweet madam, there is such a thing as
a divorce!</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> But, sweet sir, there is such a thing as alimony!
so divorce on, and spare not.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Ay, that separate maintenance is the devil&mdash;there's
their refuge!&mdash;O' my conscience, one
would take cuckoldom for a meritorious action, because
the women are so handsomely rewarded for it.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> That's an odd language, methinks, for her

<p><i>Dur.</i> Laugh? Won't she endure laughing?</p>

Quick, quick, despatch!&mdash;Odso, may be, you are
some gentleman's servant, that has brought me a letter,

<p><i>Dur.</i> 'Sdeath, madam, do I look like a carrier?</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> O, cry you mercy, I saw you just now, I mistook
you, upon my word! you are one of the travelling

<p><i>Bis.</i> Sir, your intention of waiting on me was the

may turn it to a compliment: Your visit, sir, was intended
as a prologue to a very scurvy play, of which,

above the scandal of a libel, my virtue is sufficiently
approved to those whose opinion is my interest: and,
for the rest, let them talk what they will; for, when I
please, I'll be what I please, in spite of you and all
mankind; and so, my dear man of honour, if you be

<blockquote>
<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Bob, come hither, Bob.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Your pleasure, sir?</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Are not you a great rogue, sirrah?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> That's a little out of my comprehension,
sir; for I've heard say, that I resemble my father.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Your father is your very humble slave&mdash;I
tell thee what, child, thou art a very pretty fellow,
and I love thee heartily; and a very great villain, and
I hate thee mortally.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Villain, sir! Then I must be a very impudent
one; for I can't recollect any passage of my
life that I'm ashamed of.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Come hither, my dear friend; dost see
this picture?</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Shows him a little Picture.</i></p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Oriana's? Pshaw!</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> What, sir, won't you look upon't?&mdash;Bob,
dear Bob, pr'ythee come hither now&mdash;Dost want any
money, child?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Why, then, here's some for thee: come
here now&mdash;How canst thou be so hard-hearted, an
unnatural, unmannerly rascal, (don't mistake me,
child, I a'n't angry) as to abuse this tender, lovely,
good-natured, dear rogue?&mdash;Why, she sighs for thee,
and cries for thee, pouts for thee, and snubs for thee;
the poor little heart of it is like to burst<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Come,
my dear boy, be good-natured, like your own father;
be now&mdash;and then, see here, read this<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>the effigies
of the lovely Oriana, with thirty thousand pound to
her portion&mdash;thirty thousand pound, you dog! thirty
thousand pound, you rogue! how dare you refuse a
lady with thirty thousand pound, you impudent rascal?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Will you hear me speak, sir?</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Hear you speak, sir! If you had thirty
thousand tongues, you could not out-talk thirty thousand
pound, sir.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Nay, sir, if you won't hear me, I'll begone,
sir! I'll take post for Italy this moment.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Ah, the fellow knows I won't part with
him! Well, sir, what have you to say?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> The universal reception, sir, that marriage
has had in the world, is enough to fix it for a public
good, and to draw every body into the common cause;
but there are some constitutions, like some instruments,
so peculiarly singular, that they make tolerable
music by themselves, but never do well in a
concert.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Why, this is reason, I must confess, but
yet it is nonsense too; for, though you should reason
like an angel, if you argue yourself out of a good
estate, you talk like a fool.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> But, sir, if you bribe me into bondage with
the riches of Cr&oelig;sus, you leave me but a beggar, for
want of my liberty.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Was ever such a perverse fool heard?
'Sdeath, sir! why did I give you education? was it
to dispute me out of my senses? Of what colour, now,
is the head of this cane? You'll say, 'tis white, and,
ten to one, make me believe it too<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I thought that
young fellows studied to get money.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> No, sir, I have studied to despise it; my
reading was not to make me rich, but happy, sir.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> There he has me again, now! But, sir,
did not I marry to oblige you?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> To oblige me, sir! in what respect, pray?</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Why, to bring you into the world, sir;
wa'n't that an obligation?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> And, because I would have it still an obligation,
I avoid marriage.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> How is that, sir?</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Because I would not curse the hour I was
born.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Lookye, friend, you may persuade me
out of my designs, but I'll command you out of
yours; and, though you may convince my reason that
you are in the right, yet there is an old attendant of
sixty-three, called positiveness, which you, nor all the
wits in Italy, shall ever be able to shake: so, sir,
you're a wit, and I'm a father: you may talk, but I'll
be obeyed.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> This it is to have the son a finer gentleman
than the father; they first give us breeding, that they
don't understand; then they turn us out of doors, because
we are wiser than themselves. But I'm a little
aforehand with the old gentleman. [<i>Aside.</i>] Sir, you
have been pleased to settle a thousand pound sterling
a year upon me; in return of which, I have a very
great honour for you and your family, and shall take
care that your only and beloved son shall do nothing
to make him hate his father, or to hang himself. So,
dear sir, I'm your very humble servant.<span class="ex">[<i>Runs&nbsp;off.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Here, sirrah! rogue! Bob! villain!</p>

</div>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Ah, sir! 'tis but what he deserves.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> 'Tis false, sir! he don't deserve it: what
have you to say against my boy, sir?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> I shall only repeat your own words.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> What have you to do with my words?
I have swallowed my words already; I have eaten
them up.&mdash;I say, that Bob's an honest fellow, and who
dares deny it?</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Bisarre</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Bis.</i> That dare I, sir:&mdash;I say, that your son is a
wild, foppish, whimsical, impertinent coxcomb; and,
were I abused, as this gentleman's sister is, I would
make it an Italian quarrel, and poison the whole family.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Come, sir, 'tis no time for trifling: my sister
is abused; you are made sensible of the affront, and
your honour is concerned to see her redressed.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Lookye, Mr. Dugard, good words go
farthest. I will do your sister justice, but it must be
after my own rate; nobody must abuse my son but
myself; for, although Robin be a sad dog, yet he's
nobody's puppy but my own.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> Ay, that's my sweet-natured, kind, old gentleman&mdash;[<i>Wheedling
him.</i>] We will be good, then, if
you'll join with us in the plot.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Ah, you coaxing young baggage! what
plot can you have to wheedle a fellow of sixty-three?</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> A plot that sixty-three is only good for; to
bring other people together, sir. You must act the
Spaniard, because your son will least suspect you;
and, if he should, your authority protects you from
a quarrel, to which Oriana is unwilling to expose her
brother.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> And what part will you act in the business,
madam?</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> Myself, sir; my friend is grown a perfect
changeling: these foolish hearts of ours spoil our
heads presently; the fellows no sooner turn knaves,
but we turn fools: but I am still myself, and he may
expect the most severe usage from me, because I neither
love him, nor hate him.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Well said, Mrs. Paradox! but, sir, who
must open the matter to him?</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Petit, sir; who is our engineer general; and
here he comes.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> What the devil must we know, sir?</p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> That I have [<i>Pants and blows.</i>] bribed, sir,
bribed&mdash;your son's secretary of state.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Secretary of state!&mdash;who's that, for Heaven's
sake?</p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> His valet de chambre, sir? You must
know, sir, that the intrigue lay folded up in his master's
clothes; and, when he went to dust the embroidered
suit, the secret flew out of the right pocket
of his coat, in a whole swarm of your crambo songs,
short-footed odes, and long-legged pindarics.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Impossible!</p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> Ah, sir, he has loved her all along; there
was Oriana in every line, but he hates marriage. Now,
sir, this plot will stir up his jealousy, and we shall
know, by the strength of that, how to proceed farther.</p>

to an attorney, your body to the physicians, and your
soul to its master.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> I understand her; she'll take a husband, out
of spite to me, and then, out of love to me, she will
make him a cuckold! But who is the happy man?</p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> A lord, sir.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> I'm her ladyship's most humble servant.

to work my way to my lady's couchee<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>A
countess, I presume, sir<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> A Spanish count, sir, that Mr. Dugard knew
abroad, is come to Paris, saw your mistress yesterday,
marries her to-day, and whips her into Spain
to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Y. Mir.</i> Ay, is it so? and must I follow my cuckold
over the Pyrenees? Had she married within the precincts
of a billet-doux, I would be the man to lead
her to church; but, as it happens, I'll forbid the
banns! Where is this mighty don?</p>

<p><i>Petit.</i> Have a care, sir; he's a rough cross-grained
piece, and there's no tampering with him. Would
you apply to Mr. Dugard, or the lady herself, something
might be done, for it is in despite to you, that
the business is carried so hastily. Odso, sir, here he

<p><i>Dur.</i> Sir, he's mad, and you are the cause on't.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> That may be; for I was as mad as he
when I begot him.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Mad, sir! What d'ye mean?</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> What do you mean, sir, by shutting up your
sister, yonder, to talk like a parrot through a cage?
or a decoy-duck, to draw others into the snare?
Your son, sir, because she has deserted him, he has
forsaken the world; and, in three words, has<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Hanged himself!</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> The very same&mdash;turned friar!</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> You lie, sir! 'tis ten times worse. Bob
turned friar!&mdash;Why should the fellow shave his foolish
crown, when the same razor may cut his throat?</p>

<p><i>Dur.</i> If you have any command, or you any interest
over him, lose not a minute: He has thrown himself
into the next monastery, and has ordered me to pay
off his servants, and discharge his equipage.</p>

<p><i>Old Mir.</i> Let me alone to ferret him out: I'll sacrifice
the Abbot, if he receives him; I'll try whether
the spiritual or the natural father has the most right

him out of their clutches<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Ten thousand livres a
year upon the church!&mdash;'Tis downright sacrilege&mdash;Come,
gentlemen, all hands to work: for half that
sum, one of these monasteries shall protect you a
traitor from the law, a rebellious wife from her husband,
and a disobedient son from his own father.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

I tell you, sir, she's not fit for the society of repenting
maids.</p>

<p><i>Dug.</i> Why so, sir?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> I hope, Bisarre, there is no harm in jesting
with this religious habit.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> To me, the greatest jest in the habit, is taking
it in earnest.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> But I'm reconciled, methinks, to the mortification
of a nunnery; because I fancy the habit becomes
me.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> A well-contrived mortification, truly, that
makes a woman look ten times handsomer than she
did before!&mdash;Ay, my dear, were there any religion
in becoming dress, our sex's devotion were rightly
placed; for our toilets would do the work of the altar;
we should all be canonized.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> But don't you think there is a great deal
of merit in dedicating a beautiful face and person to
the service of religion?</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> Not half so much as devoting them to a pretty
fellow. Come, come, mind your business. Mirabel
loves you, 'tis now plain, and hold him to't; give
fresh orders that he shan't see you: we get more by
hiding our faces, sometimes, than by exposing them;
a very mask, you see, whets desire; but a pair of
keen eyes, through an iron grate, fire double upon
them, with view and disguise. But I must begone
upon my affairs; I have brought my captain about
again.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> But why will you trouble yourself with
that coxcomb?</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> Because he is a coxcomb: had I not better
have a lover like him, that I can make an ass of,
than a lover like yours, to make a fool of me. [<i>Knocking
below.</i>] A message from Mirabel, I'll lay my life!
[<i>She runs to the Door.</i>] Come hither! run, thou charming
nun, come hither!</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> Don't you see who's below?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> I see nobody but a friar.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> Ah, thou poor blind Cupid! A friar! Don't
you see a villanous genteel mien, under that cloak of
hypocrisy?</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i> As I live, Mirabel turned friar! I hope, in
Heaven, he's not in earnest.</p>

<p><i>Bis.</i> In earnest! Ha! ha! ha! are you in earnest?
Remember what I say, if you would yield to advantage,
and hold out the attack; to draw him on, keep
him off, to be sure.</p>

grief; he, in whose breast I thought my heart secure,

he reserves it safe.</p>

wealth, that's prodigal of his own? His heart

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
